<p>I am a professional single mother, very busy and hard working with two daughters and demanding work, but I feel fulfilled. My profession and the motherhood for my beloved daughters gratify me fully. I begin my day with a good breakfast with my children. By 9:30 I am in my office where I work as a consumer advocate in the state governor's office for children products. All day my telephone rings, voice mails and emails swamp in, and I meet several people in the office and online conferences. In the meantime I write reports, media releases, letters and emails. After an exhausting work day, I do a lot of things to relax and at the end of the day I go to sleep happy.</p>

<h2> First Supporting Paragraph:</h2>

<p>>My busy day begins at 6 a.m. in the morning with a big breakfast I prepare for my two daughters (eleven and fourteen years old) and for myself. I spend one good hour with them in the kitchen, eating breakfast and talking with them, and preparing their lunch boxes. This time in the kitchen is very important for me to insure that my children and I have a family conversation to begin our day, counsel my children for their safety in school and after-school activities. I see them off to the school bus that picks them up before our home. Then, my house-keeper shows up, and I take a shower and get dressed by 8:15. Still with a cup of coffee lingering in my hand, I give my housekeeper the day's instructions for household chores. At 8:30 I leave home and arrive office by 9:30 where I meet with my secretary who greets me at the door with a pile of letters and messages waiting for me. She briefs me on the day's agenda for about fifteen minutes while telephone calls already begin to buzz in one after another. After I am done with my secretary, I write emails, letters and media releases as well as jiggle with incoming calls from associates, clientele and others until 1:30 in the afternoon. For lunch, I munch on a sandwich my secretary makes for me, but, occupied with multitasking--writing emails, looking for files or shuffling through documents on my desk, I hardly finish my sandwich.</p>

<h3>The Second Supporting Paragraph:</h3>

<p><In the afternoon hours, I deal with consumer groups, media representatives, and government enforcement agencies on the phone or in the office or through text-messages, while trying to get done my reports in response to inquiries of interest groups and government. These afternoon hours are very hectic with intense clients who may be upset over some defective products that harmed their children or some body, and over the indifference of the product manufacturers. Around 5 p.m. I shut down my computer, clean up my desk and dictate my secretary the next day's agenda before I live office for the gym. At the gym, I feel exhausted and force my aching body to move, and after some fifteen minutes into it, I start feeling fine with the gym instructor's soothing chakra. Then I pick my cell phone for a quick chat with my daughters. Finally I get home. I eat dinner with my children for about an hour in the dining room and exchange the day's news on school and my work. Then, I help them with their homework and they go to bed at 10 o'clock after an unavoidable fight with me for more TV time. Having done with my children for the evening, I go to my study, tune to the WQXR or Lite FM. Still, having more to get done, I pay bills or make telephone calls. I finally call it a day at midnight, go to bed for a good night sleep.</p>

<h4> Conclusion Paragraph:</h4>

<p>My life, as a single-mother and professional woman, is hectic from the early morning until the midnight. With my two daughters and highly demanding profession, I feel that the twenty-four-hour day is not enough, and I am overworked. At the end of the day, after having so much to do, working out at the gym helps me relax. What's more relaxing is that the time I spend with my daughters when dining and talking with them in the evening, and helping them with their homework. Then, I listen to the music. After a rewarding time with my children and listening to the music, I am relaxed already. My life at work and outside work is busy, but I feel the joy of fulfillment with my life.</p>
